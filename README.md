# A Three-Dimensional Hydrogeologic Framework Model
This web interface allows users to explore a 3-D geologic framework models. The geologic model consists of geologic units with their associated thickness and elevations. The subsurface geology represented in the geologic model can be viewed by two methods: 1) drawing graphic "well logs" at any site, or 2) building complete cross-sections between multiple sites. See the "General Instructions" tab for details.
